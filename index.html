<p>There are various stages of commiting...means git indicated those
    
   1.U -> untrcaked menns the new file which is NOT tracked by git.
   2.M -> modified means you have chnaged smtg in local level and not added/commited that..so git shows those file in yellow
   3.S -> Staged means file is ready to commited
   4.u -> unmodified means unchnaged means changes are added

   =>to ADD the changes we use 'git add file_name' command
   => and to add all changes toghther we use 'git add .' command

   =>to COMMIT the changes we use 'git commit -m "SOME_MSG" ' command

   #but after add & commit still the changes are not reflected on the GITHUB so fro that we use the spcl command 
   =>PUSH command ->upload local repo conr=tent to remote repo = git push origin main<!--LOCAL - PC/LAPTOP && REMOTE - GUTHUB-->
     git push origin main => origin-> name of remote repository...means the chnages that we will be doing shold be reflect on remote repo..which is on GITHUB
                            main -> Branch file name.....
         ->>>> We could use the "-u" flag with this command to mark that ,this is the branch we will have to work for long term..n we can then write only 'git push'
    
   =>changes that we done on locally...to reflect that on GITHUB...we have to create the new repo. nd have to push it..
